You can create beautiful traditional masks using materials found around your home and community:\n\n**Materials you can use:**\n- **Base:** Cardboard from old boxes, or papier-mâché made from newspapers\n- **Colors:** Natural dyes from flowers, berries, or soil; or make paint from colored chalk mixed with water\n- **Decorations:** Bottle caps, buttons, dried beans, seeds, or small stones\n- **Texture:** Cotton wool, dried grass, or fabric scraps\n\n**Simple steps:**\n1. Cut your base into a face shape\n2. Add eye and mouth holes\n3. Paint with your chosen colors\n4. Add decorative elements while paint is still wet\n5. Let dry completely\n\n**Traditional inspiration:**\n- Kikuyu masks often use earth tones (browns, reds)\n- Luo masks might include geometric patterns\n- Maasai-inspired masks could use red and blue colors\n\n**Remember:** The most important thing is your creativity and the story your mask tells.
